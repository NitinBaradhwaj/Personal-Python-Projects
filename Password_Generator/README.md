### Password-Generators-using-Python

### Decription:

Here, I have added two different codes

First one:

It is a password generator that takes input by asking the user to enter the number of digits, alphabets, and special characters they want.
When the user enters the number of characters for each type, the program will include the respective number of character types into the password.

Second one:

It is a random password generator.
Password generated is a combination of lower_case, upper_case, special_characters and numbers. Password length will 10
